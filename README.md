üé® What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website, app, or system interface. It outlines the basic structure and layout of a page before any design elements (like colors, images, or final content) are added.

Wireframes are essential tools in the UI/UX design process because they help teams:

Focus on functionality and structure without distraction

Visualize the user's journey and interactions

Identify design problems early

Align stakeholders on layout and features before development begins

üß± Key Elements of a Wireframe
Wireframes typically include the following core elements:

1. Layout Structure
Defines the basic arrangement of the page or screen.

Example: A three-column layout for a dashboard interface helps prioritize information hierarchy and user tasks.

2. Navigation
Indicates where and how users move around the system.

Example: A top menu bar or a side navigation drawer that links to main sections like "Bookings", "Profile", and "Payments".

3. Content Placement
Shows where headings, paragraphs, images, or videos will go.

Example: Placeholder text like ‚ÄúHero Section Title‚Äù or gray boxes for images helps visualize how content will be distributed.

4. Functionality
Represents interactive elements such as buttons, search fields, forms, or modals.

Example: A "Book Now" button below each listing tells developers where and how user actions will take place.
