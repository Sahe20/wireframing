ðŸŽ¨ What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website, app, or system interface. It outlines the basic structure and layout of a page before any design elements (like colors, images, or final content) are added.

Wireframes are essential tools in the UI/UX design process because they help teams:

Focus on functionality and structure without distraction

Visualize the user's journey and interactions

Identify design problems early

Align stakeholders on layout and features before development begins
