🎨 What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website, app, or system interface. It outlines the basic structure and layout of a page before any design elements (like colors, images, or final content) are added.

Wireframes are essential tools in the UI/UX design process because they help teams:

Focus on functionality and structure without distraction

Visualize the user's journey and interactions

Identify design problems early

Align stakeholders on layout and features before development begins

🧱 Key Elements of a Wireframe
Wireframes typically include the following core elements:

1. Layout Structure
Defines the basic arrangement of the page or screen.

Example: A three-column layout for a dashboard interface helps prioritize information hierarchy and user tasks.

2. Navigation
Indicates where and how users move around the system.

Example: A top menu bar or a side navigation drawer that links to main sections like "Bookings", "Profile", and "Payments".

3. Content Placement
Shows where headings, paragraphs, images, or videos will go.

Example: Placeholder text like “Hero Section Title” or gray boxes for images helps visualize how content will be distributed.

4. Functionality
Represents interactive elements such as buttons, search fields, forms, or modals.

Example: A "Book Now" button below each listing tells developers where and how user actions will take place.

🧾 Types of Wireframes
🔹 Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Basic, grayscale sketches or block diagrams

Focus on layout and navigation, not visual design

Used in early stages to brainstorm and iterate quickly

Use Case: Brainstorming layouts with stakeholders before any code or design work begins.

🔸 High-Fidelity Wireframes
Detailed and polished wireframes with accurate spacing, fonts, and sometimes real content

Closely resemble the final product, often created using tools like Figma or Adobe XD

Used in later stages for developer handoff or usability testing

Use Case: Finalizing UI flow and ensuring design alignment before moving to development.

📌 What Type of Wireframe Is Linked?

The wireframe linked is a high-fidelity wireframe of the ALx Airbnb redesign, as it is more detailed and colored, with layout, content structure, and user flow with detailed styling, color schemes, and structured text. It is close to the final design and intended for feedback validation before development starts.
